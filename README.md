# arduino_led_rubiks_cube
Disclaimer: This was in 2019, and we didn't even know about Git yet, so we had to scrape together Code and PCB files from old chats. We take no guarantee that this works and is up-to-date :).

## Description
Arduino based LED Rubik's Cube. 
This Project was made as a High-school Project with two other Students. To achieve this, we had to:
- Design of PCB's encompassing the buttons, LED's and shift registers with EAGLE
- Designing and Printing of the cubes case
- Assembling and Wirering the PCB's and Arduino
- Write the Code in Arduino IDE with C++

## Problems we encountered
- We were all pretty new to Computer Science and Electrical Engineering. We made many mistakes but learned many things in the process.
- We accidentally ordered the wrong type of LEDs (common anode instead of common cathode) for the PCB without realizing it. In the end, we had to desolder some of the LEDs again :(
- There were mistakes in the first version of the PCB design, which caused us to get dangerously close to the deadline due to long delivery times.

## PCB designs
The PCBs were designed with the Eagle software. Design files can be found in the Repo and here are some Screenshots:
